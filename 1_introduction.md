# Chapter 1. Introduction

## Welcome to Programming
- Donald Knuth describes programming not as a telling a computer how to do something, but telling a erson how they would instruct a computer to do something.
- A programmer is a problem-solver, a poet, and an instructor all at once.
- At the end of this book, you should be able to do the following:
	- Understand how a program works and interacts with other programs
	- Read other people's programs and learn how they work
	- Learn new programming languages quickly
	- Learn advanced concepts in computer science quickly
- Don't get discouraged. It's a long climb, but very worthwhile.
- At the end of each chapter are three sets of review exercises:
	1. Regurgitation - checking if you can give back what you learned in the chapter.
	2. Application questions - checking if you can apply what you learned to solve problems.
	3. If you are capable of broadening your horizons, things to think about and to return to in the future.
- Learning the issues involved in programming, learning how to research answers, and elarning how to look ahead are all major parts of a programmer's work.
