# Dealing with Complexity
Programmers use functions to:
- Make development easier for others.
- Maintain an entire project.

Functions:
- Do one particular thing.
- Have defined interfaces that allow it to work with other functions.
- Consumes data and produce an output.
- Compose a single application in the hundreds and even thousands.

Function interfaces:
- Are made up of the function's parameters and definitions of what happens to that data.
- Are designed so carefully because they will be called everywhere.

Primitive functions or primitives:
- Are provided by the system.
- Are the atomic elements that is used to build everything else from.
- Come across as kernel system calls in assembly programming.

Programming can either be:
- Breaking an application down into smaller and smaller pieces until primitive functions are concerned.
- Incrementally building functions on top of primitives until the larger picture of the application comes into focus.
